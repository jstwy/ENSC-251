[OBJECTIVES]
- create a class with
    > two constructors
        >> a constructor for entering zip codes to encode
        >> a constructor for entering barcodes to decode
    > at least two public member functions
        >> a function to return zip code as integer
        >> a function to return zip code as string (barcode)
        >> other functions...?
    > private helper functions
- test the class within a test program (q1.cpp)
    > error checking
        >> integer input error checking
        >> string input error checking
- internal storage of zip code?
    > as integer?
    > as string?
